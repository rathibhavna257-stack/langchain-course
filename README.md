💡 What You'll Build

This course takes you through building 7 real-world AI agent projects, from simple hello-world applications to advanced agentic systems:

Project	Type	Description
👋 LangChain Hello World	Branch (project/hello-world)	Your first AI agent - basic structure and LLM integration
🔎 Modern Search Agent	Branch (project/search-agent)	Build search agents using LangChain v.1's create_agent interface with custom tools, Tavily integration, and structured outputs
🔎 Classic ReAct Search Agent	Branch (project/ReAct-search-agent)	ReAct agent with search capabilities using the original create_react_agent from langchain-classic
🧠 ReAct Algorithm Under the Hood	Branch (project/ReAct-Algo)	Understanding reasoning and acting patterns in AI agents
📄 RAG Gist	Branch (project/rag-gist)	The gist of retrieval-augmented generation
📚 Documentation Helper	External Repo	Intelligent documentation assistant
💻 Code Interpreter	Branch (project/code-interpreter)	AI-powered code execution and analysis
🪞 Reflection Agent	External Repo	Self-improving agent with reflection and critique capabilities
🔄 Reflexion Agent	External Repo	Advanced self-correcting agent using reflexion techniques
🤖 Agentic RAG	External Repo	Advanced retrieval-augmented generation system
